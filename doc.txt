The idea is to have everything grouped by commands and standarize what each file provides.

BotClient - handles reading the messages, matching them against command regexes in BotFuntions, extracting arguments from them, passing them to 
    appropriate command function in BotFunctions, and send the returned string to the channel.

BotCommands - is a library of commands, contains regex for each of them, to make the checking for commands easier and to make
    extracting function arguments from them easy and readable.

BotFunctions - handles the "behind the scenes" calculations, has a function for each command. Always returns a string to be send out
    to the channel by the BotClient.

BotOptions - contains options that the user are most likely to change, like the language the bot answers in, the language of character skills
    or command prefix.
